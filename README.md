HOCKEY CARD GAME: How To Play.

The Hockey Card Game is based loosely on the game of hockey, where players "break away" before scoring a goal.

Age: Adults and older children

No. of Players: 2 players

Objective: To score more goals than your opponent.

1. Hockey Card Game begins with both players cutting the deck. The player with the highest card can choose whether to deal or become the first player.

2. The dealer shuffles the deck and then deals five cards to each player, one at a time. Each player looks at their cards, without letting the other player see them.

3. The first player chooses a card and places it face up on the table between the players. The opposing player tries to match the card, to form a "breakaway". For example, if Player One put down a '6', then Player Two would try to put any other '6' on it, forming a breakaway. If they have no matching card, they can play any other card.

4. Play alternates, with each player trying to match the previous card. If they can get two matches in a row (that is, create a "breakaway" and then create another match) they have scored a goal. For example;

    Player One: 4♠
    Player Two: 4♦ (a breakaway)
    Player One: K♥
    Player Two: K♠ (a GOAL!)

If a player on a breakaway does not score a goal with their next card, the breakaway has been 'intercepted'. A new breakaway will need to occur before there can be a chance to score another goal.

5. In Hockey Card Game, a player who places any Jack on the table immediately scores a breakaway.

6. Only one player at a time can have a breakaway. For example, Player One puts down a '3'. Player Two puts down a '3' and scores a breakaway. However, Player One puts down a third '3', cancelling player Two's breakaway and scoring a breakaway for themselves.

7. Once each player has played their five cards, the dealer immediately deals another five cards each and play continues. If a player was already on a breakaway, they can try for a goal from the first cards put down. Play continues for another two deals of five cards. The full set of deals (four x 5 cards) is called a 'Period'.
